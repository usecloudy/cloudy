# Cloudy Main App

This app is kind of a hodge podge right now. It's both an electron app and a web app. We'll need to clean it up but this is done in order to support both web and desktop.

## Setup

### Setup Node
Install node, I recommend using nvm.

### Install Dependencies
Run `npm install` to install dependencies

### Setup environment variables
Copy `.env.example` to `.env` and set the appropriate environment variables.

### Start the Dev Server
Run `npm run react:dev` to start the web app.

App will be served at http://localhost:3000
